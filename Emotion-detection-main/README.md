# Emotion-detection
In this project, a research to classify facial emotions over static facial images using 
deep learning techniques was developed. This is a complex problem that has 
already been approached several times with different techniques. 
2. While good results have been achieved using keras models.While the results 
achieved were not state-of-the-art, they were slightly better than other techniques 
including feature engineering.
3. It means that eventually DL techniques will be able to solve this problem given an 
enough amount of labeled examples.
4. While feature engineering is not necessary, image pre-processing boosts 
classification accuracy.
5. A solution totally based on feature learning does not seem close yet because of a 
major limitation: the lack of an extensive dataset of emotions. 
6. Emotion classification could be achieved by means of deep learning techniques
